                        <p>Hello there! My name is Filip and I am a full-stack .NET student, passionate about technology
                            and design. Every day I am eagerly gaining new knowledge and insights
                            in this fast and versatile world of software development.</p>
                        <p>I am advancing from a successful career in Supply Chain Management, most recently at Siemens. 
                            Currently I am in my first year of a comprehensive .NET training program at Chas Academy in Stockholm.</p>
                        <p>Now I am looking forward to channel my creativity through crafting functional, beautiful and high performance 
                            software for engaging experiences.</p>
                        <p>When I manage to escape my computer's grasp, I enjoy working out, HIFI, photography, and
                            exploring nature.</p>
